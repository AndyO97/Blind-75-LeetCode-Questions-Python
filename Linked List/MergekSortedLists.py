# Merge k Sorted Lists
# You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
# Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.
# Example 1:
# Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


# About heapq
# heapq is used to achieve O(1) complexity to get smallest element out of a bunch elements. 
# A detail to know for Python3 heaqp is: when I heappush a tuple, by default, tuple[0] will be used to compare with existing tuplesâ€™ tuple[0],
# if there is equal pair, tuple[1] will be used.

# Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. 
# This implementation uses arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k, counting elements from zero.


# heapq.heappush(heap, item)
#     Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

# heapq.heappop(heap)
#     Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised. 
#     To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].

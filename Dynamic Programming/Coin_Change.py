# Coin Change
# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

                    # Set the index in the array to the minimum of:
                    # -If another coin worked previously in the loop, the updated number of coins will be here. 
                        # Otherwise, it will have amount + 1 as the value (As initialized in the array) which will never be the minimum.
                    # -Or the amount of coins it took to get to the current amount minus the actual coin and add a coin of that value 
                        # Will also set to one the number of coins if the curent coin value is equal to the current amount (1 + dp[x - x] = 1).

        # If it is equal to that value, return -1 since no combination of coins can reach that value.

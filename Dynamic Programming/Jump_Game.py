# Jump Game

# You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
# Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

# Solution:
#  Start from the second last element of the list and move backwards until we reach the first element in the list.
# As we iterate through the list in reverse order, we determine if each position is good or bad. A position is good if it is possible to reach the last index from that position. Else, it is bad.

        minStepsRequired = 0
        # previousGood, on the other hand, stores the index of that position.
        # We initialise previousGood to the index of the last element in nums as weâ€™ll be iterating nums backwards
